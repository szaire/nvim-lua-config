# nvim-lua-config
My own Neovim init.lua config (I used the sample lua kickstart for... well... a kickstart :P)

## My specs contains:
- "jk" for INSERT mode
- Move code along **(with alt+j and alt+k)** the file without needing to delete it.
- Relative Numbers (and a keymap to toggle to just numbers, **space + n**)
- Default tab size = 4
- Highlighted Cursorline
- Scrolloff Range = 6
- Auto and Smart Identation
- Close Window Confirmation
